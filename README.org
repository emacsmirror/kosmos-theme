Black and lightgray emacs-theme... sometimes not.

Sometimes I feel there are too many colors for the code I stare at.

And it looks like I care of only 3 colored things:

   1. Comments -- clearly visible and distinct but not too aggressive (I am looking at you, firebrick!)
   2. Strings  -- did I miss a quote?
   3. Keywords -- a bit of standout

* More than thousand words
