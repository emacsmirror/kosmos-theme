Black and lightgray emacs-theme... sometimes not.

Sometimes I feel there are too many colors for the code I stare at.

And it looks like I care of only 3 colored things:

   1. Comments -- clearly visible and distinct but not too aggressive (I am looking at you, firebrick!)
   2. Strings  -- did I miss a quote?
   3. Keywords -- a bit of standout

* TO DO
  - find color for git-commit-nonempty-second-line
  - clojure (font-lock-warning-face --> cider-repl-stderr-face) is ugly
  - snippet mode clash white {} with pair highlighting
